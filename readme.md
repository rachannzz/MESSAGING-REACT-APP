# Messaging App

## Description:
 I'd like to extend my sincere gratitude to Extraterra1, Rabin, and Krischal for their invaluable contributions, guidance, and support throughout the development process. Your dedication and expertise have played a significant role in shaping the success of this messaging app.

This messaging app project is built as part of The Odin Project curriculum. It utilizes React for the frontend, Express for the backend, and MongoDB as the database. The app provides users with the ability to add friends, create group chats, and upload pictures to enhance communication.
Welcome to the React Express Messaging App repository! This project has been a journey of approximately three months for me as a novice developer,  React, Express, and MongoDB. Through this endeavor, I've gained invaluable insights into full-stack development and honed my skills in crafting dynamic web applications.
